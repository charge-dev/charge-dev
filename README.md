`Full Stack Developer â€¢ Discord Bot Developer`

## About Me
I'm Charge and I've been coding for more than 5 years. At first, I started as a Sketchware App Developer but after some time I realized I had to step it up a notch and decided to learn how to build Discord bots using Discord.js. After some time passed since the UltraBot release, I decided to take it seriously, so I started to put time and effort into learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the web basics. After that I was crazy enough to make the decision to start learning Game Development. I started using Unreal Engine 5 and working on horror games on my own just for fun but after 8 months I started an indie horror game development team named Xyle Games.
